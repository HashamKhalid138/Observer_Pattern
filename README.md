# Observer Pattern Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the **Observer Design Pattern** in java language.

## Description
The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern where an object, called the **subject**, maintains a list of its dependents, known as **observers**, and automatically notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern is used to create a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing for a modular and flexible system where observers can dynamically register or remove themselves from the subject. It is commonly used in event-driven systems and applications requiring real-time updates.

## Features
- Implementation of the subject-observer relationship.
- Dynamic addition and removal of observers.
- Efficient state change notification mechanism.

## How the Observer Pattern Works
1. **Subject**: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any changes.
2. **Observer**: Registers with the subject to receive updates and defines a method to handle notifications.
3. **Notification**: When the subject's state changes, all registered observers are notified.
